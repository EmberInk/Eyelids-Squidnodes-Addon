# Welcome to the unoffical Eyelids Squidnodes addon!

**_You don't need to have squidnodes_** but it is assumed you do

Installing is *simular* to squidnodes,
1. Download the *Eyelids addon.blend* file
2. Save the file to somewhere that you can access easily
3. Either create a new blend file, or open an existing one
4. Under the "File" dropdown menu, select "Append"
5. Locate the *Eyelids addon.blend* file
6. A folder labelled "NodeTree" should be present. Click into this folder
7. Select **_only_ Eyelids(squidnodes addon)** inside the folder and tick the "Fake User" box on the right hand side of the file dialog 
8. Click "Append"
9. Now you can add it in just like the other squidnodes

**note:** There are no input textures
