# Welcome to the unoffical Eyelids Squidnodes addon!

**_You should already have squidnodes_** and it is assumed you know what and how to use squidnodes

Installing is *simular* to squidnodes,
1. Download the *Eyelids addon.blend* file from our distribution page here: https://github.com/PastaOwO/Squidnodes
2. Save the file to somewhere that you can access easily
3. Either create a new blend file, or open an existing one
4. Under the "File" dropdown menu, select "Append"
5. Locate the *Eyelids addon.blend* file
6. A folder labelled "NodeTree" should be present. Click into this folder
7. Select **_only_ Eyelids(squidnodes addon)** inside the folder and tick the "Fake User" box on the right hand side of the file dialog 
8. Click "Append"
9. Now you can add it in just like the other squidnodes
